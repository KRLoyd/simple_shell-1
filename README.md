###-What is the Shell

The shell (Also referred to as Shellbook, or Abra) is a series of functions capable of reading an argument and activating requested commands, along with options to a specified file or files.

###-Synopsis
./abra
[command] [options] [FILE]
###-Description
The shell begins, and displays a prompt for input. From here a lexical analyzer turns the inputted string into tokens, which then is parsed to an executor to activate the requested argument and options.


###-Example of Usage
./abra
